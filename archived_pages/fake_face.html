      <h1>Deep Learning-based Portrait Mode</h1>
      <p><strong>I trained a very deep convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct face image from the input face image. The input/output image size is 224x224x3, the encoded feature maps size is 7x7x64. Therefore, many less-important features will be ignored by the encoder (in other words, the decoder can only get limited information from the encoder). The training dataset has more than 200K celebrity images, the decoder will learn how to "draw" a face based on the encoded information (for instance: gender, hair color, etc.) and also to make a face looks like a celebrity. The training lasted 20 hours, on a Nvidia GTX 1080Ti GPU.</strong></p>
